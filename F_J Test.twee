As Lia heads to the car, you run to the bathroom. 

You’re 6 weeks pregnant, but you’ve noticed some cramping this morning and you want to head to the bathroom just to be sure. Sure enough, you notice some spotting and get a little concerned.

<<next 4s>><em>"I’m sorry, but due to recent legal restrictions on abortion care, we are no longer accepting maternity patients before at least 12 weeks,"</em> she responds.

The woman on the phone explains that because many women miscarry in the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy, their physicians did not want to be liable for an investigation under the grey area those appointments fell under.

In shock, you decide to:

[[Call more doctor offices. Surely someone will take you in.->callmore]]

The staff take your vitals, draw blood, and give you an ultrasound - but no one gives you answers. 

Later, the doctor tells you the ultrasound shows your baby stopped growing a few weeks ago, and only has a faint heartbeat. But no one will confirm if you are having a miscarriage.

The hospital can’t answer any of your questions about the baby or what’s going to happen next. One of the nurses offers to pray for you. 

<em>"It appears that you could be having a miscarriage, but we don't want to say that's what it is. So let's just keep watching it. You can continue to come back. Of course, we're praying for you,"</em> they say.

You ask if there is any medication they can give you to alleviate the bleeding and the pain.

<em>"We’re not doing that now,"</em> the doctor explains, pointing out that those drugs are the same ones used for medication abortion. Due to recent abortion restrictions in Louisiana, they can't be prescribed to you.

The doctor also refuses to refer you somewhere else for treatment, saying that  

<em>"We cannot declare you are having a miscarriage on your discharge papers, because that would flag an investigation from the state."</em>

[[You are sent home once again. ->home2 ]]<br>

The heavy bleeding and cramps continue. You grieve for the loss of your baby, but also fear for your own health.

You make it to Deja’s apartment and immediately start whispering, trying to come up with a plan. 

Deja's sister Tiffany says she can’t drive you that far, so she suggests getting a plane ticket to Virginia on a budget airline. You really don’t want to have to fly after the procedure but it doesn’t seem like you have an option. 

After searching for tickets, you realize that even all the money you have saved up from lifeguarding last summer isn't enough to get you to Virginia in the coming days. The only flights within your budget are for a month later.

<div class="row"><div class="column right">This story was based on the story of Emma Burns's experience. 

Emma Burns was a college student at Northern Arizona University when she needed an abortion. Before Emma could proceed, however, she was required by state law to view an ultrasound, listen to her fetal heartbeat, and wait more than a week for a follow-up appointment with a physician. Emma was able to clear the hurdles placed between her and the care she needed, and today credits her abortion with saving her life.
